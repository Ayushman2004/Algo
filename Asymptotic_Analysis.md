# Asymptotic Notation and Analysis (Based on input size) in Complexity Analysis of Algorithms

Asymptotic notation is a way to describe the running time or space complexity of an algorithm based on the input size. It is commonly used in complexity analysis to describe how an algorithm performs as the size of the input grows.


## The three most commmonly used notations are

* Big O notation (O)
* Omega notation (Ω)
* Theta notation (Θ)

### 1. Big O notation (O):
This notation represents the worst-case scenario (upper bound) i.e. the maximum amount of time or space an algorithm may take to solve a problem.

### 2. Omega notation (Ω):

This notation represents the best-case scenario (lower bound) i.e. the minimum amount of time or space an algorithm may take to solve a problem.

### 3. Theta notation (Θ):

This notation represents the average-case scenario (both upper and lower bound) i.e. the amount of time or space an algorithm typically needs to solve a prolem.
